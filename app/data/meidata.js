var brief = "Mei-Li Rose is a British Jeweller who learnt her trade in Birmingham, at the centre of the UK's jewellery trade. In 2012 she began the process of starting her own business and came to me with a request for a logo design. The key requirements were that it needed to be strong, modern and timeless"
var solution = "We collaborated to achieve a logotype that she was happy with and it was then applied to a website design. Since then the designers at Sharpener Agency have created a fine website, meaning the design below was never used. The logo however still remains the same and is still sits well within the updated brand."
