var brief = 'Mount Kimbie are an electronic music duo, consisting of Dominic Maker and Kai Campos.

var solution = 'The result was a visual play on the refinement in sound Mount Kimbie have undergone. A photographed and digitally enhanced rocky surface printed onto vinyl wrap with an abstraction of a polished gem waiting to be uncovered beneath.'
